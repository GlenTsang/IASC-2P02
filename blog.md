##More Multimodal Scholarship

In their work, both Moretti and Drucker argue that visual forms should be combined with written text. Digital humanities scholarship should follow suit to create multimodal scholarship where readers interpret both the text and other media. The ability to interpret multiple forms of media will be extremely beneficial to digital humanities scholarship. 

Many scholarly articles are hard to read and understand, intimidating readers with a wall of text explaining a topic rather than showing it. Creating multimodal scholarship where readers have media other than text will help with interpretation. Moving back and forth between different media provides context for the reader. For example, when Drucker and Moretti explain their findings, they reference graphs that are included in the reading. The graphs provide context while the text provides an explanation. 

Moretti uses lots of graphs in his work, he switches back and forth frequently from text to visual media to illustrate his point. Moretti uses the graphs as evidence to back up his point. He uses multiple graphs to demonstrate the patterns between the number of novels made and the popularity of different genres. The connection he draws between these two graphs is a good example of how multimodality can help a reader interpret and understand a reading. Moretti could not have illustrated his points so clearly without including his graphs. The visual aspect of this work is integral to the presentation of the main idea. As Moretti says, “close reading won’t help here...it’s a collective system, that should be grasped as such, as a whole—and the graphs that follow are one way to begin doing this.”(p.67-68). Just reading the text won't help with understanding Moretti’s point, text and visual forms should be viewed as one rather than two individual media. 

	Similarly, Drucker also uses a lot of graphs to demonstrate her idea. She gets her point across by showing visual forms. She argues that data should be viewed through a more humanistic lens and taken as a capta, meaning that it should be open to interpretation. “This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta...Capta is ‘taken’ actively while data is assumed to be a “given” able to be recorded and observed.”(sct.3).  Drucker’s article is a good example of how visualization is key to understanding. She displays her data in a certain way so that her idea can be illustrated. Without showing us graphs, her unique interpretation could not be conveyed. She argues that data should be open to interpretation, and is subjective to the reader. In this endeavour, multimodality is integral as visualizations must be shown for a reader to make a subjective interpretation. Drucker’s graphs are also unique. She orders elements by size, colour, texture, and shape, more than just quantitative elements. This allows the reader to make even more interpretations. “A humanistic approach is centered in the experiential, subjective conditions of interpretation.”(sct.13). Drucker believes that the most humanistic approach is the most subjective one, where a reader makes an interpretation with the mindset that data is capta. This further proves that multimodality is the next step in digital humanities scholarship. A more humanistic approach is needed, therefore more multimodality is required.

By looking at this visualization, one can interpret what the main points of the article are. One can determine that this article is about the humanities and interpretation of information. Through the link tool, one can see what each term relates to each other, furthering a reader's understanding of the text. Using visualizations like these alongside text can help a reader quickly understand what the writer is saying. Using different forms of media like this is important for the future of the digital humanities. Those working in the digital humanities should be able to interpret multiple forms of media and draw connections between them. 

An article written by digital humanists from Italy further argues the importance of multimodality. Society has witnessed the sudden and widespread introduction of new technology, with that technology comes new forms of media. This article demonstrates the importance of images when learning. Sometimes it is not enough to just explain concepts and they need to be shown to be fully understood. The end of the article talks about new ways of teaching with new technology. An interactive whiteboard was made, “on the surface it is possible to write, manage files, images, videos and browse the web resources... The students were very interested in using the IWB.”(sct.14). Although this is not specifically about an article, I think that this interactive whiteboard proves how multimodality is needed in scholarly articles. Students were more interested and more receptive when they can interpret media subjectively.

In conclusion, the digital humanities should create more multimodal scholarship. Moretti and Drucker are correct, written text should be combined with visual media in the digital humanities. It is shown to be beneficial to the reader’s understanding of the text and the author’s presentation of their ideas.
